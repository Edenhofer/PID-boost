\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This thesis would not have been possible without the continues support of numerous people. First of all, I would like thank my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Thomas~Kuhr for the chance to work in his research group as a Bachelor's student. By providing helpful and constructive feedback at every opportunity, he gave me inspiring insights into various topics of experimental particle physics. Of cource, I would also like to thank James~Kahn and Dr.~Martin~Ritter for providing profound answers to all of my questions.
Specifically, I would like to thank Dr.~Michael~Bender, Dr.~Martin~Ritter and Jakob~Roth as well for proofreading my thesis and giving valuable feedback.

Furthermore, thank you to all the students at the working group of Prof.~Dr.~Kuhr for their welcoming attitude and for making my stay an enjoyable time. Thank you, Christoph Ames, Anna Bertolini, Nan-Hee Kang, Yasin Silyanoglu, Daniel Moritz and Jakob Roth.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family which has always supported me in countless ways.

Thank you all!
