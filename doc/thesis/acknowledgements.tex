\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This thesis would not have been possible without the continues support of numerous people. I would like to start by thanking my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Kuhr for the opportunity to work in his research group as a Bachelor's student. By providing helpful and constructive feedback at every opportunity, he gave me inspiring insights into to topic of experimental particle physics. Furthermore, I would like to thank James Kahn for providing in depth answers to all of my questions.
In addition, a big thank you to Dr.~Martin~Ritter and Dr.~Michael~Bender for proofreading the thesis and giving valuable feedback.

Lastly, thank you to all the other students at the working group of Prof.~Dr.~Kuhr for their welcoming attitude and for making my stay an enjoyable time.

Thank you to all of you!
