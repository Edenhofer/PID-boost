\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This thesis would not have been possible without the continues support of numerous people. I would like to start by thanking my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Thomas~Kuhr for the opportunity to work in his research group as a Bachelor's student. By providing helpful and constructive feedback at every opportunity, he gave me inspiring insights into the topic of experimental particle physics. Furthermore, I would like to thank James~Kahn and Dr.~Martin~Ritter for providing in depth answers to all of my questions.
In addition, a big thank you to Dr.~Michael~Bender, Dr.~Martin~Ritter and Jakob~Roth for proofreading the thesis and giving valuable feedback.

Furthermore, thank you to all the other students at the working group of Prof.~Dr.~Kuhr for their welcoming attitude and for making my stay an enjoyable time. Thank you, Christoph Ames, Anna Bertolini, Nan-Hee Kang, Yasin Silyanoglu, Daniel Moritz and Jakob Roth.

Last but not least, I would like to extend a big thank you to my family which has always supported me in countless ways.

Thank you!
